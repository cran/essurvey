\usage{
import_sddf_country(country, rounds, ess_email = NULL, format = NULL)

import_all_sddf_cntrounds(country, ess_email = NULL, format = NULL)

download_sddf_country(
  country,
  rounds,
  ess_email = NULL,
  output_dir = getwd(),
  format = "stata"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{country}{a character of length 1 with the full name of the country. 
Use \code{\link{show_countries}} for a list of available countries.}

\item{rounds}{a numeric vector with the rounds to download. See \code{\link{show_sddf_cntrounds}}
for all available rounds for any given country.}

\item{ess_email}{a character vector with your email, such as "your_email@email.com".
If you haven't registered in the ESS website, create an account at 
\url{http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/user/new}. A preferred method is to login
through \code{\link{set_email}}.}

\item{format}{the format from which to download the data. By default it is NULL for \code{import_*} functions and tries to read 'stata', 'spss' and 'sas' in the specific order. This can be useful if some countries don't have a particular format available.  Alternatively, the user can specify the format which can either be 'stata', 'spss' or 'sas'.
For the \code{download_*} functions it is set to 'stata' because the format should be
specified before downloading. Setting it to \code{NULL} will iterate over 'stata',
'spss' and 'sas' and download the first that is available. When using \code{import_country}
the data will be downloaded and read in the \code{format} specified. For \code{download_country},
the data is downloaded from the specified \code{format} (only 'spss' and 'stata' supported,
see details).}

\item{output_dir}{a character vector with the output directory in case you want to
only download the files using \code{download_sddf_country}. Defaults to your working
directory. This will be interpreted as a \strong{directory} and not a path with
a file name.}
}
\value{
for \code{import_sddf_country} if \code{length(rounds)} is 1, it returns a tibble with
the latest version of that round. Otherwise it returns a list of \code{length(rounds)}
containing the latest version of each round. For \code{download_sddf_country}, if
\code{output_dir} is a valid directory, it returns the saved directories invisibly and saves
all the rounds in the chosen \code{format} in \code{output_dir}

Download SDDF data by round for countries from the European Social Survey
}
\details{
SDDF data (Sample Design Data Files) are data sets that contain additional columns with the
sample design and weights for a given country in a given round. These additional columns are
required to perform any complex weighted analysis of the ESS data. Users interested in using this data
should read the description of SDDF files \href{http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/methodology/ess_methodology/sampling.html}{here}
and should read \href{http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/data/download_sample_data.html}{here} for the
sampling design of the country of analysis for that specific round.

Use \code{import_sddf_country} to download the SDDF data by country into R.
\code{import_all_sddf_cntrounds} will download all available SDDF data for a given country by
default and \code{download_sddf_country} will download SDDF data and save them in a specified
\code{format} in the supplied directory.

The \code{format} argument from \code{import_country} should not matter to the user
because the data is read into R either way. However, different formats might have
different handling of the encoding of some questions. This option was preserved
so that the user can switch between formats if any encoding errors are found in the data. For more
details see the discussion \href{https://github.com/ropensci/essurvey/issues/11}{here}.

Additionally, given that the SDDF data is not very complete, some countries do not have SDDF data
in Stata or SPSS formats. For that reason, the \code{format} argument is not used in \code{import_sddf_country}.
Internally, \code{Stata} is chosen over \code{SPSS} and \code{SPSS} over \code{SAS} in that
order of preference.

For this particular argument, 'sas' is not supported because the data formats have
changed between ESS waves and separate formats require different functions to be
read. To preserve parsimony and format errors between waves, the user should use
'stata' or 'spss'.

Starting from round 7 (including), the ESS switched the layout of SDDF data.
Before the rounds, SDDF data was published separately by wave-country
combination. From round 7 onwards, all SDDF data is released as a single
integrated file with all countries combined for that given round. \code{import_sddf_country}
takes care of this nuance by reading the data and filtering the chosen
country automatically. \code{download_sddf_country} downloads the raw file but also
reads the data into memory to subset the specific country requested. This
process should be transparent to the user but beware that reading/writing the data might delete
some of it's properties such as dropping the labels or label attribute.
