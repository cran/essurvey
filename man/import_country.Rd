\usage{
import_country(country, rounds, ess_email = NULL, format = "stata")

import_all_cntrounds(country, rounds, ess_email = NULL, format = "stata")

download_country(country, rounds, ess_email = NULL, output_dir = getwd(),
  format = "stata")
}
\arguments{
\item{country}{a character of length 1 with the full name of the country. 
Use \code{\link{show_countries}} for a list of available countries.}

\item{rounds}{a numeric vector with the rounds to download. See \code{\link{show_rounds}}
for all available rounds.}

\item{ess_email}{a character vector with your email, such as "your_email@email.com".
If you haven't registered in the ESS website, create an account at 
\url{http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/user/new}. A preferred method is to login
through \code{\link{set_email}}.}

\item{format}{the format from which to download the data. Can either be 'stata',
'spss' or 'sas', with 'stata' as default. When using \code{import_country} the
data will be downloaded and read in the \code{format} specified.
For \code{download_country}, the data is downloaded from the specified
\code{format} (only 'spss' and 'stata' supported, see details).}

\item{output_dir}{a character vector with the output directory in case you want to
only download the files using \code{download_country}. Defaults to your working
directory. This will be interpreted as a \strong{directory} and not a path with
a file name.}
}
\value{
for \code{import_country} if \code{length(rounds)} is 1, it returns a tibble
with the latest version of that round. Otherwise it returns a list of \code{length(rounds)}
containing the latest version of each round. For \code{download_country}, if 
\code{output_dir} is a valid directory, it returns the saved directories invisibly
and saves all the rounds in the chosen \code{format} in \code{output_dir}
}
\description{
Download integrated rounds separately for countries from the European Social Survey
}
\details{
Use \code{import_country} to download specified rounds for a given country and
import them to R.
\code{import_all_cntrounds} will download all rounds for a given country by default
and \code{download_country} will download rounds and save them in a specified
\code{format} in the supplied directory.

The \code{format} argument from \code{import_country} should not matter to the user
because the data is read into R either way. However, different formats might have
different handling of the encoding of some questions. This option was preserved
so that the user
can switch between formats if any encoding errors are found in the data. For more
details see the discussion \href{https://github.com/ropensci/essurvey/issues/11}{here}.
For this particular argument, 'sas' is not supported because the data formats have
changed between ESS waves and separate formats require different functions to be
read. To preserve parsimony and format errors between waves, the user should use
'spss' or 'stata'.
